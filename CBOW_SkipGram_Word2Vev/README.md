This model is from Word2Vec paper, from section ->3.1 Continuous Bag-of-Words Model and section -->3.2 Continuous Skip-gram Model. 
Softmax is applied to it rather than Huffman Binary tree for both the model.
for the Skip Gram model, the input, target pairs are created for each of the center word and its surrounding words(context)

the model is not fully trained.
